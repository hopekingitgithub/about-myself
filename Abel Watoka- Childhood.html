        <h2>Childhood Memories</h2>
        <p>
            My childhood was a time filled with joy, laughter, and unforgettable experiences.
            I have fond memories of what i used to make big computers using clay soil as i advanced by moving to where i can get computers to use. These moments with
            my family and friends played a significant role in shaping who I am today.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether it was hard for me to use computers bt i tried to know everything physically, each experience contributed
            to my personal growth and helped define my interests and values.
        </p>

        <p>
            Family interactions were a cornerstone of my childhood  by helping me by providing enough time and take me where i can get accesed to technology and this reminds me now that we should be supportive to others . These moments created a strong foundation for the person I am becoming.
